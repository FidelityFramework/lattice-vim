# Ionide Heritage

## The Ion → Lattice Progression

This project is a hard fork of [Ionide-vim](https://github.com/ionide/Ionide-vim), part of the excellent [Ionide](https://ionide.io/) F# IDE tooling ecosystem created by Krzysztof Cieślak.

### Why "Lattice"?

In chemistry, ions are individual charged particles. When ions bond together in organized
3D structures, they form **crystal lattices**—giving rise to emergent properties like
conductivity, strength, and optical characteristics.

Similarly, Ionide provides exceptional tooling for F# development with .NET. Lattice extends
this foundation to support polyglot systems programming with F# Native.

The name "Lattice" honors this progression: from individual tools to an integrated system.

## Original Ionide Project

- **Creator**: Krzysztof Cieślak
- **Website**: https://ionide.io/
- **License**: MIT

We are deeply grateful to Krzysztof and all Ionide contributors for creating the exceptional
foundation we build upon.

## Why Fork?

Lattice serves a fundamentally different use case:
- Native/freestanding F# compilation (no .NET/BCL)
- Polyglot pipelines (F#, MLIR, LLVM, F*, Lua, C)
- `.fidproj` TOML projects vs `.fsproj` MSBuild

**Lattice does NOT compete with Ionide.** We serve different communities.

## License Compliance

Lattice preserves the original MIT License with Ionide copyright holders.
